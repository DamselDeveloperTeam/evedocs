<h2>Known bugs</h2>

<p>
While everything works in various simulators, hardware is a different story, however. For example, fifth generation iPad and iPhone SE work, while iPhone 8 does not, due to insufficient memory. In order to get around this, the application needs refactoring. The source code is provided here for users to tinker as much as they want.
